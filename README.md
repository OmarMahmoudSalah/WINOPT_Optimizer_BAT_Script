# WinOPT .bat Script
The Windows Optimizer Script was a hobby script I wrote to fulfill a need of mine: I wanted to clean and perform several automated built-in actions with just one click! Microsoft has already supplied and maintained all of the tools, which include disk cleanup, defragmentation, system scans, and more!

This tool calls for a logical sequence of most of the tools you may need to optimize your PC with one click.
